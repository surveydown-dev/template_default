A minimum template for starting from scratch.

To create this template, run this command in your R console:

```r
surveydown::sd_create_survey(
  #path = "path/to/survey"
)
```

There is a `template = "default"` argument in the `sd_create_survey()` function, but it is set as default so no need to specify it.

Refer to the [Start with a template](https://surveydown.org/docs/getting-started#start-with-a-template) section for more details.
